What is a monolithic kernel?,A monolithic kernel is a type of kernel where the core functions including process management memory management and device drivers are all integrated into a single large block of code.
What is a microkernel?,A microkernel is a type of kernel that aims to provide minimal functionality in the kernel space leaving most services such as device drivers file systems and network protocols to user-space processes.
What is kernel space?,Kernel space is a memory area where the core of the operating system (the Windows kernel) runs with high privileges. It has direct access to hardware and system resources.
What is user space?,User space is the memory area where user-level applications and processes run. It operates with lower privileges than kernel space limiting direct access to hardware.
What is the role of a device driver in the kernel?,A device driver is software that enables the Windows kernel to communicate with hardware devices. It abstracts the details of the hardware and provides a standardized interface for the kernel and applications to use.
How does the kernel manage memory?,The Windows kernel manages memory through a memory management unit (MMU) which handles the allocation deallocation and swapping of memory between processes to ensure efficient use of system resources.
What is a system call?,A system call is a request made by a user-space program to the Windows kernel to perform privileged operations such as file access process control or device manipulation.
How does the kernel manage processes?,The Windows kernel manages processes by scheduling them for execution on the CPU allocating resources such as memory and I/O devices and ensuring that they do not interfere with each other.
What is process scheduling?,Process scheduling is the method by which the Windows kernel determines which processes are executed by the CPU and for how long. It ensures that all processes receive a fair share of system resources and helps prevent starvation.
What is a context switch?,A context switch occurs when the Windows kernel saves the state of a running process and loads the state of another process. This enables multitasking by allowing multiple processes to share the CPU.

What is interrupt handling in the kernel?,Interrupt handling is the process by which the Windows kernel responds to interrupts—signals from hardware or software that require immediate attention. The kernel suspends its current activities to handle the interrupt.
What is a process?,A process is an instance of a program in execution. It consists of the program code its data and its execution context which includes CPU registers memory and other resources.
What is a thread?,A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Multiple threads within the same process can share resources like memory while running independently.
What is multitasking?,Multitasking is the ability of an operating system to run multiple processes or threads concurrently giving the illusion of simultaneous execution on a single CPU.
What is a kernel thread?,A kernel thread is a thread that is managed and executed by the Windows kernel. Unlike user threads kernel threads have direct access to kernel resources.
What is a user thread?,A user thread is a thread that is managed by a user-level thread library with the kernel unaware of its existence. User threads rely on kernel threads for execution.
What is a kernel thread vs a user thread?,Kernel threads are managed by the Windows kernel have full access to kernel resources and can perform privileged operations. User threads are managed by a user-level thread library and operate in user space.
What is a file system?,A file system is a method for organizing storing and retrieving files on storage devices. The kernel provides the file system interface for applications to interact with files.
What is a block device?,A block device is a type of storage device that allows data to be read or written in fixed-size blocks such as hard drives SSDs and USB drives.
What is a character device?,A character device is a type of device that handles data as a stream of characters such as a keyboard or a serial port.
What is I/O scheduling?,I/O scheduling is the method by which the Windows kernel manages the input/output operations to ensure efficient use of system resources and minimize delays in device communication.
What is a buffer in the kernel?,A buffer is a temporary memory area used to store data being transferred between different components of the system such as between the CPU and I/O devices.
What is a filesystem mount?,A filesystem mount is the process by which the operating system makes a storage device or file system available for access by the system and applications.
What is the role of the kernel in process creation?,The Windows kernel is responsible for creating and managing processes allocating resources setting up process context and scheduling the process for execution.
What is the purpose of the init process?,The init process is the first process created by the Windows kernel during boot. It is responsible for initializing system services and managing system startup tasks.
What is a system call table?,A system call table is a data structure used by the Windows kernel to map system call numbers to the corresponding kernel functions. It enables the kernel to handle system calls efficiently.
What is a kernel buffer?,A kernel buffer is a temporary storage area used by the Windows kernel to store data during input/output operations typically used to improve performance by reducing the number of I/O operations.
What is kernel space memory?,Kernel space memory is the portion of the system's memory that is reserved for the kernel and its operations. It has higher privileges than user space memory.
What is user space memory?,User space memory is the area of memory where user-level applications and processes run. It is isolated from kernel space to prevent unauthorized access to system resources.
What is the difference between kernel space and user space?,Kernel space is reserved for the Windows kernel and system-level operations while user space is where user applications run. Kernel space has higher privileges and can directly access hardware whereas user space operates with restricted access.
What is a process control block?,A process control block (PCB) is a data structure used by the Windows kernel to store information about a process such as its state program counter memory allocation and CPU registers.
What is an interrupt vector?,An interrupt vector is a table that the Windows kernel uses to map interrupt requests to specific interrupt handlers or routines enabling the system to respond to hardware and software interrupts.
What is a system resource?,A system resource refers to any part of the hardware or software that is required by processes to function such as CPU time memory disk space or network bandwidth.
